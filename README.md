## Abstract
A website designed to help parents locate autism treatment providers in Utah. Users can search for and filter providers by county, insurance, and availability of Spanish-speaking services, using a Google Maps embedded API. The site will also feature autism screening tools, such as the M-CHAT and the CAST, along with educational resources about autism. Users can contact the admin via email using EmailJS, and providers will have the ability to log in and edit their information as needed.
