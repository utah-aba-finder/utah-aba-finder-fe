# Mobile "Under Construction" Issue - Fix Guide

## Problem
Your Autism Services Locator website is showing "under construction" messages on mobile browsers, creating a poor user experience.

## Root Cause
This issue is typically caused by:
1. **Browser caching** - Mobile browsers cache old content
2. **Service worker conflicts** - Outdated service workers serving cached content
3. **CDN caching** - Content delivery networks serving stale content
4. **Local storage issues** - Cached user preferences causing display problems

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Cache-Busting Headers ✅
- Added `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` headers
- Updated `netlify.toml` with proper cache control
- Added meta tags to prevent browser caching

### 2. Service Worker Management ✅
- Created new service worker (`sw.js`) with version control
- Added automatic cache clearing for old service workers
- Implemented proper cache invalidation

### 3. Mobile-Specific Error Handling ✅
- Added mobile detection and cache clearing
- Implemented automatic reload on construction message detection
- Created utility functions for cache management

### 4. Local Storage Cleanup ✅
- Clear problematic localStorage items on mobile
- Reset user preferences that might cause issues
- Force fresh content loading

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify
- Push changes to your Git repository
- Netlify will automatically deploy with the new `netlify.toml` configuration
- The new headers will prevent caching issues

### 3. Clear Existing Caches (Manual)
If users are still seeing the issue:

#### For Users:
1. **Clear browser cache**: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
2. **Hard refresh**: Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. **Incognito/Private mode**: Test the site in private browsing

#### For Developers:
1. **Clear Netlify cache**: Go to Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Build & deploy → Clear cache
2. **Force redeploy**: Trigger a new deployment
3. **Check CDN**: Verify CDN settings are not caching old content

### 4. Monitor and Test
- Test on various mobile devices and browsers
- Check browser developer tools for cache issues
- Monitor console for any remaining errors

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Version Control
- Update the version in `package.json` and `manifest.json` when deploying
- Use semantic versioning for better cache management

### 2. Monitoring
- Add error tracking (e.g., Sentry) to monitor mobile issues
- Set up alerts for construction message detection

### 3. User Communication
- Add a banner for users experiencing issues
- Provide clear instructions for clearing cache

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test on iOS Safari
- [ ] Test on Android Chrome
- [ ] Test on mobile Firefox
- [ ] Test in incognito/private mode

## Emergency Fixes

If the issue persists immediately after deployment:

1. **Force cache invalidation**:
   ```javascript
   // Add to index.html temporarily
   <script>
     if ('caches' in window) {
       caches.keys().then(names => names.forEach(name => caches.delete(name)));
     }
     localStorage.clear();
     sessionStorage.clear();
   </script>
   ```

2. **Add version parameter to URLs**:
   ```javascript
   // Force reload with version parameter
   window.location.href = window.location.href + '?v=' + Date.now();
   ```

3. **Contact hosting provider** to clear CDN cache
